/**
* Mails out allocations to TAs.
*
* Usage: 
*   1. Check that BLOCKLIST_SPREADSHEET_URL points to the TA Blocklists sheet.
*   2. Replace ANONYMIZED_MAPPINGS_SPREADSHEET_URL with a url that points to the anonymized 
*      mappings spreadsheet for the current assignment. Make sure DUPLICATED_HANDINS_SHEET_NAME 
*      is set to the name of the sheet that maps handins that have been duplicated across 
*      different IDs.
*   3. Run the `allocateHandins` function by selecting it in the above dropdown and pressing the 
*      Run button. A sheet will be added to the spreadsheet at ANONYMIZED_MAPPINGS_SPREADSHEET_URL
*      titled "Allocations", which contains the IDs allocated to each TA.
